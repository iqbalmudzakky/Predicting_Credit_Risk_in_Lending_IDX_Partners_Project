# Predicting_Credit_Risk_in_Lending_IDX_Partners_Project
I provided valuable risk management recommendations, leading to enhanced borrower oversight and collections management. I played a pivotal role in developing specialized financial products for low-risk borrowers, resulting in improved loan portfolio diversification. Additionally, I significantly contributed to refining borrower selection processes, leading to improved loan performance and reduced credit risk. I collaborated on the creation of financial education programs aimed at enhancing borrower financial literacy and reducing risk. My risk prediction modeling achieved a remarkable 95% recall rate, enabling proactive measures against payment delays and defaults. I also explored potential partnerships with other financial institutions, expanding the company's product offerings. Furthermore, I implemented dynamic interest rate strategies that optimized revenue while mitigating credit risk. I enhanced customer monitoring systems, leading to early detection of payment patterns and potential issues, and I played a role in considering personalized services based on borrower characteristics, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction. Additionally, I proposed the development of financial education apps to improve borrower financial management and payment tracking.
